    \brief The QStyleHints class contains platform specific hints and settings.
    \inmodule QtGui

    An object of this class, obtained from QGuiApplication, provides access to certain global
    user interface parameters of the current platform.

    Access is read only; typically the platform itself provides the user a way to tune these
    parameters.

    Access to these parameters are useful when implementing custom user interface components, in that
    they allow the components to exhibit the same behaviour and feel as other components.

    If you support drag and drop in your application, and want to start a drag

    with a button held down, you should use this property's value as the
    minimum distance required.

    For example, if the mouse position of the click is stored in \c startPos
    and the current position (e.g. in the mouse move event) is \c currentPos,
    you can find out if a drag should be started with code like this:
