    \class QAccessible
    \brief The QAccessible class provides enums and static functions
    related to accessibility.
    \internal

    \ingroup accessibility
    \inmodule QtWidgets

    This class is part of \l {Accessibility for QWidget Applications}.

    Accessible applications can be used by people who are not able to
    use applications by conventional means.

    The functions in this class are used for communication between
    accessible applications (also called AT Servers) and
    accessibility tools (AT Clients), such as screen readers and
    braille displays. Clients and servers communicate in the following way:

    \list
    \li  \e{AT Servers} notify the clients about events through calls to the
        updateAccessibility() function.

    \li  \e{AT Clients} request information about the objects in the server.
        The QAccessibleInterface class is the core interface, and encapsulates
        this information in a pure virtual API. Implementations of the interface
        are provided by Qt through the queryAccessibleInterface() API.
    \endlist

    The communication between servers and clients is initialized by
    the setRootObject() function. Function pointers can be installed
    to replace or extend the default behavior of the static functions
    in QAccessible.

    Qt supports Microsoft Active Accessibility (MSAA), Mac OS X
    Accessibility, and the Unix/X11 AT-SPI standard. Other backends
    can be supported using QAccessibleBridge.

    In addition to QAccessible's static functions, Qt offers one
    generic interface, QAccessibleInterface, that can be used to wrap
    all widgets and objects (e.g., QPushButton). This single
    interface provides all the metadata necessary for the assistive
    technologies. Qt provides implementations of this interface for
    its built-in widgets as plugins.

    When you develop custom widgets, you can create custom subclasses
    of QAccessibleInterface and distribute them as plugins (using
    QAccessiblePlugin) or compile them into the application.
    Likewise, Qt's predefined accessibility support can be built as
    plugin (the default) or directly into the Qt library. The main
    advantage of using plugins is that the accessibility classes are
    only loaded into memory if they are actually used; they don't
    slow down the common case where no assistive technology is being
    used.

    Qt also includes two convenience classes, QAccessibleObject and
    QAccessibleWidget, that inherit from QAccessibleInterface and
    provide the lowest common denominator of metadata (e.g., widget
    geometry, window title, basic help text). You can use them as
    base classes when wrapping your custom QObject or QWidget
    subclasses.

/*!
    \class QAccessible::State

    \inmodule QtGui

    This structure defines bit flags that indicate
    the state of an accessible object. The values are:

    \value active                  The object is the active window or the active sub-element in a container (that would get focus when focusing the container).
    \value adjustable              The object represents an adjustable value, e.g. sliders.
    \value animated                The object's appearance changes frequently.
    \value busy                    The object cannot accept input at the moment.
    \value checkable               The object is checkable.
    \value checked                 The object's check box is checked.
    \value checkStateMixed         The third state of checkboxes (half checked in tri-state check boxes).
    \value collapsed               The object is collapsed, e.g. a closed listview item, or an iconified window.
    \value defaultButton           The object represents the default button in a dialog.
    \value defunct                 The object no longer exists.
    \value editable                The object has a text carret (and often implements the text interface).
    \value expandable              The object is expandable, mostly used for cells in a tree view.
    \value expanded                The object is expanded, currently its children are visible.
    \value extSelectable           The object supports extended selection.
    \value focusable               The object can receive focus. Only objects in the active window can receive focus.
    \value focused                 The object has keyboard focus.
    \value hasPopup                The object opens a popup.
    \value hotTracked              The object's appearance is sensitive to the mouse cursor position.
    \value invalid                 The object is no longer valid (because it has been deleted).
    \value invalidEntry            Input validation current input invalid.
    \value invisible               The object is not visible to the user.
    \value linked                  The object is linked to another object, e.g. a hyperlink.
    \value marqueed                The object displays scrolling contents, e.g. a log view.
    \value modal                   The object blocks input from other objects.
    \value movable                 The object can be moved.
    \value multiLine               The object has multiple lines of text (word wrap), as opposed to a single line.
    \value multiSelectable         The object supports multiple selected items.
    \value offscreen               The object is clipped by the visible area. Objects that are off screen are also invisible.
    \value passwordEdit            The object is a password field, e.g. a line edit for entering a Password.
    \value playsSound              The object produces sound when interacted with.
    \value pressed                 The object is pressed.
    \value readOnly                The object can usually be edited, but is explicitly set to read-only.
    \value selectable              The object is selectable.
    \value selectableText          The object has text which can be selected. This is different from selectable which refers to the object's children.
    \value selected                The object is selected.
    \value selfVoicing             The object describes itself through speech or sound.
    \value sizeable                The object can be resized, e.g. top-level windows.
    \value summaryElement          The object summarizes the state of the window and should be treated with priority.
    \value supportsAutoCompletion  The object has auto-completion, for example in line edits or combo boxes.
    \value traversed               The object is linked and has been visited.
    \value updatesFrequently       The object changes frequently and needs to be refreshed when accessing it.
    \value disabled                The object is unavailable to the user, e.g. a disabled widget.

    Implementations of QAccessibleInterface::state() return a combination
    of these flags.

                                            this event. It is not sent when an object is hidden as
                                            it is being obcured by others.

                                            be caused by a mouse press on the slider handle, for
                                            example.

    \class QAccessibleInterface
    \brief The QAccessibleInterface class defines an interface that exposes information
    about accessible objects.
    \internal

    \ingroup accessibility
    \inmodule QtGui

    This class is part of \l {Accessibility for QWidget Applications}.

    Accessibility tools (also called AT Clients), such as screen readers
    or braille displays, require high-level information about
    accessible objects in an application. Accessible objects provide
    specialized input and output methods, making it possible for users
    to use accessibility tools with enabled applications (AT Servers).

    Every element that the user needs to interact with or react to is
    an accessible object, and should provide this information. These
    are mainly visual objects, such as widgets and widget elements, but
    can also be content, such as sounds.

    The AT client uses three basic concepts to acquire information
    about any accessible object in an application:
    \list
    \li \e Properties The client can read information about
    accessible objects. In some cases the client can also modify these
    properties; such as text in a line edit.
    \li \e Actions The client can invoke actions like pressing a button
    or .
    \li \e{Relationships and Navigation} The client can traverse from one
    accessible object to another, using the relationships between objects.
    \endlist

    The QAccessibleInterface defines the API for these three concepts.

    \section1 Relationships and Navigation

    The functions childCount() and indexOfChild() return the number of
    children of an accessible object and the index a child object has
    in its parent. The childAt() function returns a child QAccessibleInterface
    that is found at a position. The child does not have to be a direct
    child. This allows bypassing intermediate layers when the parent already knows the
    top-most child. childAt() is used for hit testing (finding the object
    under the mouse).

    The relations() function provides information about the relations an
    object has to other objects, and parent() and child() allows
    traversing from one object to another object.

    \section1 Properties

    The central property of an accessible objects is what role() it
    has. Different objects can have the same role, e.g. both the "Add
    line" element in a scroll bar and the \c OK button in a dialog have
    the same role, "button". The role implies what kind of
    interaction the user can perform with the user interface element.

    An object's state() property is a combination of different state
    flags and can describe both how the object's state differs from a
    "normal" state, e.g. it might be unavailable, and also how it
    behaves, e.g. it might be selectable.

    The text() property provides textual information about the object.
    An object usually has a name, but can provide extended information
    such as a description, help text, or information about any
    keyboard accelerators it provides. Some objects allow changing the
    text() property through the setText() function, but this
    information is in most cases read-only.

    The rect() property provides information about the geometry of an
    accessible object. This information is usually only available for
    visual objects.

    \section1 Interfaces

    To enable the user to interact with an accessible object the
    object must implement QAccessibleActionInterface in addition to
    QAccessibleInterface.
    Objects that support selections can define actions to change the selection.

    There are several other interfaces that should be implemented as required.
    QAccessibleTextInterface should be used for bigger texts edits such as document views.
    This interface should not be implemented for labels/single line edits.
    The complementary QAccessibleEditableTextInterface should be added when the
    Text is editable.

    For sliders, scrollbars and other numerical value selectors QAccessibleValueInterface
    should be implemented.

    Lists, tables and trees should implement QAccessibleTableInterface.

    \sa childCount(), parent()
*/

/*!
    \fn QString QAccessibleInterface::text(QAccessible::Text t) const

    Returns the value of the text property \a t of the object.

    The \l QAccessible::Name is a string used by clients to identify, find, or
    announce an accessible object for the user. All objects must have
    a name that is unique within their container. The name can be
    used differently by clients, so the name should both give a
    short description of the object and be unique.

    An accessible object's \l QAccessible::Description provides textual information
    about an object's visual appearance. The description is primarily
    used to provide greater context for vision-impaired users, but is
    also used for context searching or other applications. Not all
    objects have a description. An "OK" button would not need a
    description, but a tool button that shows a picture of a smiley
    would.

    The \l QAccessible::Value of an accessible object represents visual information
    contained by the object, e.g. the text in a line edit. Usually,
    the value can be modified by the user. Not all objects have a
    value, e.g. static text labels don't, and some objects have a
    state that already is the value, e.g. toggle buttons.

    The \l QAccessible::Help text provides information about the function and
    usage of an accessible object. Not all objects provide this
    information.

    The \l QAccessible::Accelerator is a keyboard shortcut that activates the
    object's default action. A keyboard shortcut is the underlined
    character in the text of a menu, menu item or widget, and is
    either the character itself, or a combination of this character
    and a modifier key like Alt, Ctrl or Shift. Command controls like
    tool buttons also have shortcut keys and usually display them in
    their tooltip.

    All objects provide a string for \l QAccessible::Name.
