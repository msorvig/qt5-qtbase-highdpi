/*!
    \fn QWidget *QWidget::createWindowContainer(QWindow *window, QWidget *parent, Qt::WindowFlags flags);

    Creates a QWidget that makes it possible to embed \a window into
    a QWidget-based application.

    The window container is created as a child of \a parent and with
    window flags \a flags.

    Once the window has been embedded into the container, the
    container will control the window's geometry and
    visibility. Explicit calls to QWindow::setGeometry(),
    QWindow::show() or QWindow::hide() on an embedded window is not
    recommended.

    The container takes over ownership of \a window. The window can
    be removed from the window container with a call to
    QWindow::setParent().

    The window container has a number of known limitations:

    \list

    \li Stacking order; The embedded window will stack on top of the
    widget hierarchy as an opaque box. The stacking order of multiple
    overlapping window container instances is undefined.

    \li Window Handles; The window container will explicitly invoke
    winId() which will force the use of native window handles
    inside the application. See \l {Native Widgets vs Alien Widgets}
    {QWidget documentation} for more details.

    \li Rendering Integration; The window container does not interoperate
    with QGraphicsProxyWidget, QWidget::render() or similar functionality.

    \li Focus Handling; It is possible to let the window container
    instance have any focus policy and it will delegate focus to the
    window via a call to QWindow::requestActivate(). However,
    returning to the normal focus chain from the QWindow instance will
    be up to the QWindow instance implementation itself. For instance,
    when entering a Qt Quick based window with tab focus, it is quite
    likely that further tab presses will only cycle inside the QML
    application. Also, whether QWindow::requestActivate() actually
    gives the window focus, is platform dependent.

    \li Using many window container instances in a QWidget-based
    application can greatly hurt the overall performance of the
    application.
